​Description
​This deposit represents the final, production-ready code library for the Law of Geometric Order (LGO) Unified Theory V13.0. This Python monofile package is specifically designed to provide independent, analytical verification of the theory's most crucial structural claims.
​The library verifies two foundational claims linking geometry to physics:
​Analytical Lepton Mass Derivation: Confirms the non-empirical derivation of the electron (m_e) and muon (m_{\mu}) masses as direct outputs of the Geometric Operator \mathcal{L} spectrum (specifically, the first Riemann Zero, \gamma_1). This demonstrates the structural origin of the mass hierarchy.
​Gravitational Constant Consistency: Calculates the Geometric Flaw (\delta) and provides the final structural closure required to achieve perfect alignment with the CODATA value for the Gravitational Constant, completing the unification framework.
​The repository is structured as a single, easily traceable file (lgo_structural_verification.py) for maximum transparency and scientific reproducibility.
